**DevBook** is a full-featured social network application developed as the final project for the course *"Learn Golang from Scratch! Build a Complete Application"*.

This project was essential for consolidating advanced Go concepts, including concurrency, authentication (JWT), database integration, and the architectural separation between API and Frontend.

## 🚀 Features

The system is divided into two main modules: **API** (Backend) and **WebApp** (Frontend).

### 🔐 Authentication & Security
- User Registration and Login.
- Authentication via **JWT Tokens** (JSON Web Token).
- Custom Middlewares for route protection.

### 👥 Social Network
